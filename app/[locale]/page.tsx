/**
 * Front page — r7 variant GRID.
 *
 * The quiet one, and the closest to what the brand already does: a static field
 * of ink circles on a fixed grid, which is the 76px hairline grid's grammar with
 * a heavier mark.
 *
 * Coverage 0.129 — by some distance the lightest screen in the round. The claim
 * has to carry the page almost unaided, which may be exactly right for a page
 * whose brief has twice been "too much".
 *
 * The cost: it is a texture, not a picture. It says nothing about the product,
 * and it does not move.
 *
 * SHARED BY ALL SIX r7 VARIANTS
 * The layout is r6-playhead, unchanged and already chosen. **Only the screen
 * differs**, because the founder asked whether `halftone-dots` was the right
 * shader at all — and a round that also moved the layout could not answer that.
 *
 * Three variants hold the shader and change the base image; two change the
 * shader; one changes nothing and is the control. That split is the experiment:
 * it separates "which shader" from "which picture", which six free-form designs
 * could not.
 *
 * Every candidate was rendered and measured before it was proposed —
 * `node tools/shader-survey.mjs`. Most of the library never reached the page:
 * `mesh-gradient`, `god-rays`, `metaballs`, `liquid-metal`, `warp`, `voronoi`
 * and the rest blend many colours or glow, and W5 bans blur while W8 bans
 * decorative gradients. They cannot be expressed in a three-colour palette, so
 * they are not taste rejections.
